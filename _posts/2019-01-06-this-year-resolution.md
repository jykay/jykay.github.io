Here is the list of projects that I want to accomplish as this year's resolution.

```
1. Music file organizer for random music files in the order of genre, album, artist.
2. Spectrum sensing report system with oneM2M
3. SDR-based specturm sensing using lightweight hardware with successive approximation
4. Linux-based evernote scanner setup integrating to the evernote account
5. Telematics design in oneM2M perspectives
```


Also, here is the list of my personal goals as resolution.

```
1. Weight loss up to 170 lb
2. Sustain the level of english proficiency
3. Substantial improvement of my income portfolios
4. Record the post in a daily basis
```

I wish I follow  all of my resoluton in a proper manner. If there is any interrupt or event happened, I will let you know.

Today's comment: This is my first one. Of course, this website is my first time based on Github Pages. I like it so far. Took me a whole day to figure out how to make it work though.
