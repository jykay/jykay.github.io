Make no mistakes. I love what I am doing, but I feel trapped sometimes. I want to explore more and now it is the time.

My previous post said that I wanted to have a substantial improvement of my income portfolios. That actually includes to move an other work place.

I applied a bunch (no actually very few), and I got a rejection letter. Uh, feels hurt, but already move on to other position. Of course, my self-esteem is destroyed a little, and my hesitation level is gone up. Will see what will happen next.

Today, I had a dinner with my ex-colleagues for the farewell near the work place. It was a good dinner, and we were happy where we stand. Although we are sad about the fact for good-bye, We shared good memories and promised to work together someday when we are grouped again.

Today's comment: I am drunk tonight. I do not feel to update my source code. Maybe next time.
