Quick things to say

1. Talk to my English tutor. Unable to schedule on today evening, but agreed to plan on Thursday evening.

2. Quality control has been never easy since the beginning of the work. Almost the end and I do not want to fail for sure.

3. Should've worked on coding or writing papers. I will definitely reply to soon-to-be-future co-author and professor for my circumstance and proposal of continuation of writing.

4. This is the end I guess. Summer vacation plan is almost finalized as my wife and I unanimously agreed to go to Boston and Greater Boston.

5. Will come back home on time tomorrow and take the passport photo for my passport application.

Today's comment: I am pretty tired today. I accomplished a lot today but feel left something at the same time.
