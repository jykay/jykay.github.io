I got a notice that my filed marriage license was approved. I printed out and showed my wife. She loved it and the fact that I am her husband, not domestic partner.

My work has been intense since the morning. My S/W document work becomes double, and my final process for the serivce got nowhere. At least, there is a hope (not big though, rather be very slim chance) that I can make it pass. Will see

Today's comment: This is my three consecutive day not working on my personal stuff. What a shame. In addition, I drank a beer with my wife for celebration. I am glad that I did it, but I need to work on something at the same time.
